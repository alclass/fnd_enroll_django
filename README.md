fnd_enroll_django
===================

fnd_enroll_django is a simple CLI computer system, written mostly in Python, that is useful for a college student to manage disciplines available for enrollment.

More precisely, its use was planned to help the user visualize opportunities of elective disciplines time slots close against to required disciplines' times.  For this, it's supposed that various elective discipline concur their times differently and the student, ie, the user, is capable of choosing one or more of them, having possibly some time coincidences when choosing one means giving up another.
